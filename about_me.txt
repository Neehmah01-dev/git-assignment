My name is Adebowale Nimota Oluwatobi, but somehow i love to be called and to refer myself as NEEHMAH OR NI'HMAH because that is the correct pronuciation of my name in arbaic
but being a youruba girl it was bastardized by the culture.I am a law student who is paassionate about teaching, reading, listening and writing.
